                  <p>
                    My name is Dao Anh Vu, and my student ID is s3926187. I grew up In Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam. Currently, I am a first-year student at RMIT University, studying for a degree in Information Technology. I consider myself to be a rather ordinary guy with a multitude of hobbies, including reading comic books, mysterious stories on the Internet, and of course, playing video games. I frequently found myself immersed in a video game or stories with rich lore and spent dozens of hours learning about them. The thrill of unraveling a riddle, discovering why a character is a way they are, or how the game’s universe came to be in its current shape fascinated me. Apart from that, I enjoy messing around with computers and learning about new technology. I feel incredibly fortunate to have had a chance to interact with computers at a young age. Since then, I have always been curious about how computers and applications work in the background, how codes can turn into characters that we control in video games, or how a click of a button can order pizza for us. By learning IT, I will be able to answer all those questions, plus I will also have the abilities and knowledge to possibly build my own applications. For the time being, I have some basic knowledge about programming languages like Python, JavaScript, a little bit of web programming with HTML, CSS as well as fundamental database concepts with MySQL. I hope that by joining RMIT, I can expand my understanding of computers and programming and therefore be better prepared for future jobs.

                  <p>
                    My name is Bui Khac Tien, and my student ID is s3925982. I am currently 18 years old, and Hanoi is my hometown. Presently, this is my second semester in Bachelor of Information Technology. I have numerous hobbies, including reading books, playing tennis, playing drums, and especially solo traveling. An odd fact about me is I am an ambivert. It means sometimes I would be extraverted, and I would talk a lot and rant about life to other people, but also sometimes I would be introverted and want to be isolated at home. The introverted side of me has discovered the passion inside myself for computers and networks. At first, when I got to RMIT, I was very interested in the Data Analytics stream. However, after some weeks, I realized that Data Analytics was not for me because it requires many skills that do not fit me. Then, I remembered that I had played many games in the past, and when it went down for maintenance, I realized it was shut down due to the “cloud platform.” Seeing it applicant widely throughout many software, I decided to switch my interest to the Cloud Technologies minor. Besides, I have been using computers for 16 years. When I was 3, my father brought home an IBM laptop and gave it to me to explore the “magic” at that time, the Internet. Soon, I developed a passion for Information Technology and how to use computers to solve real-life problems. I have learned basic Python, HTML, CSS, and some of MySQL for the time being. I believe with my dedication, in the future, I could apply my knowledge achieved from RMIT classes to real life.

                    My name is Hoang Vinh Khue, and my student ID is s3927474. This is my second semester at RMIT in Hanoi, where I am studying Information Technology. Using computers to browse and explore the Internet as well as playing video games has always been one of my favorite pastimes since I was a child. As I’ve grown older, technology has become an increasingly important aspect of everyone’s life, including mine. I’ve always been fascinated by how humans can develop things like computers and the Internet, and I would like to learn more about the topic of technology. I also really like playing video games and aspire to be a game developer. I firmly believe that RMIT would be the place that provides me with the environment and opportunity to pursue my dream.

                    My name is Nguyen Dang Ha, and my student ID is s3924594. I was born and brought up in Hanoi. Gaming and using computers are my biggest hobbies.  My first experience with computers and technology was when I was 5. However, until I grew 13, I was only aware of how miraculous technology is, and along with its rapid development at that point, my interest in IT was formed. Specifically, I am always interested in how a program was created and how we made other people interact with our products with only clicks and touches,... Moreover, technology plays a bigger and bigger role in our society, and it affects almost every aspect of our life. Even though I was far behind what is called expert, I would give my best to contribute more to projects and hope to take another step in this field.

                    My name is Do Hong Quang, with the student ID s3939374. Currently, I am a freshman at RMIT University, Hanoi Campus, and studying Information Technology. I discovered the potential in this field and how it can change our lives after seeing AlphaGo defeated Lee Se-dol convincingly. I have pursued my dream of becoming a data scientist from that point. I currently have a foundation knowledge of Python and SQL and a little HTML and CSS. Besides, I also love reading about algorithms and ML. I believe that with the environment that RMIT provides, I can push through my limit and achieve higher points in my life.

                After spending a month working on this project, we all appreciate each member's contribution to the group. 
                Initially, our workflow did not follow the plan flawlessly because of the lack of conversations and meetings. 
                However, after having an in-person meeting, we had the opportunity to understand each other more thoroughly. 
                Therefore, we could split the workload among all members in the most suitable way. All members had the chance to 
                work in the most comfortable field while also supporting others to further strengthen other required skills 
                for an IT student. We always tried to maintain a healthy working environment in our group, avoiding any argument 
                by finding common ground for everyone. All members have the right to raise their opinion if they find any problem, 
                and everyone will have a short conversation to solve it. Furthermore, anyone in the group has the right to file a 
                complaint if they believe that the workload between members is not equally divided.

                There are a total of five members in our group project. Although we have our own different career paths, we all share one common goal: to use technology and our knowledge acquired from the Information Technology major to make the world a better place. Firstly, our team’s leader, Tien, is the person who behinds every member and pushes them beyond their possibilities. He is the person who keeps all team members satisfied and makes sure the project goes on the right track. He also takes charge of assigning tasks to members and hosts every meeting. Tien has a dream of becoming a Cloud Engineer, which would seem capable to him because he has had an enlightened passion since his childhood. Secondly, we have Vu, the brain of our whole team. Vu is a smart, hard-working, and enthusiastic person in every project and task he participates in. He is the one who came up with many ingenious ideas and had the ability to create fascinating lines of code. Thirdly, we are proud to have Quang as our member. Quang is creative, diligent, and always engaged with ideas. Surprisingly, Vu and Quang share the same passion for data and want to follow the Data Analytics stream. The next member of our team is our astute teammate Khue, who is always looking for new ways to solve problems. For years, Khue has wanted to train robots to become smarter, and the Artificial Intelligence minor is allowing him to do just that. The last piece of our team is Ha. Ha may not be a talkative person, but when our team is going through a difficult time, he always has the best solution in his mind, ready to save us. As a hardcore gamer, he always wants to develop a game that satisfies his creativity and share it with everyone else. That explains why Ha chose his path as a Mobile Developer. There are many similarities between our group members’ future careers. We all need to complete our degrees in Information Technology and have a basic understanding of some common programming languages. Furthermore, most employers require us to be fluent in English and capable of working in a team. However, some fields demand more previous work experience than others. Even though our ambitions are distinct from each other, we always try our best to work as a team and create an astonishing project.
