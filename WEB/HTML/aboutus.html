            My name is Dao Anh Vu, and my student ID is s3926187. I grew up In Hanoi,
            the capital city of Vietnam. Currently, I am a first-year student at
            RMIT University, studying for a degree in Information Technology. I
            consider myself to be a rather ordinary guy with a multitude of hobbies,
            including reading comic books, mysterious stories on the Internet, and
            of course playing video games. I frequently found myself immersed in a
            video game or stories with rich lore and spent dozens of hours learning
            about them. The thrill of unraveling a riddle, discovering why a character
            is the way they are, or how the game's universe came to be in its current
            shape fascinated me. Apart from that, I enjoy messing around with computers
            and learning about new technology. I feel incredibly fortunate to have had
            a chance to interact with computers at a young age. Since then, I have
            always been curious about how computers and applications work in the background,
            how codes can turn into characters that we control in video games, or how a
            click of a button can order pizza for us. By learning IT, I will be able to
            answer all those questions, plus I will also have the abilities and knowledge
            to possibly build my own applications. For the time being, I have some basic
            knowledge about programming languages like Python, JavaScript, a little bit
            of web programming with HTML, CSS as well as fundamental database concepts
            with MySQL. I hope that by joining RMIT, I can expand my understanding of
            computers and programming and therefore be better prepared for future jobs.

            My name is Bui Khac Tien, and my student ID is s3925982. I am
            currently 18 years old, and Hanoi is my hometown. Presently, this is
            my second semester in Bachelor of Information Technology. I have
            numerous hobbies, including reading books, playing tennis, playing
            drums, and especially solo traveling. An odd fact about me is I am
            an ambivert. It means sometimes I would be extraverted, and I would
            talk a lot and rant about life to other people, but also sometimes I
            would be introverted and want to be isolated at home. The
            introverted side of me has discovered the passion inside myself for
            computers and networks. At first, when I got to RMIT, I was very
            interested in the Data Analytics stream. However, after some weeks,
            I realized that Data Analytics was not for me because it requires
            many skills that do not fit me. Then, I remembered that I had played
            many games in the past, and when it went down for maintenance, I
            realized it was shut down due to the "cloud platform." Seeing it
            applicant widely throughout many software, I decided to switch my
            interest to the Cloud Technologies minor. Besides, I have been using
            computers for 16 years. When I was 3, my father brought home an IBM
            laptop and gave it to me to explore the "magic" at that time, the
            Internet. Soon, I developed a passion for Information Technology and
            how to use computers to solve real-life problems. I have learned
            basic Python, HTML, CSS, and some of MySQL for the time being. I
            believe with my dedication, in the future, I could apply my
            knowledge achieved from RMIT classes to real life.

            My name is Do Hong Quang, with the Student ID s3939374. Currently, I
            am a freshman at RMIT University, Hanoi Campus, and studying
            Information Technology. I discovered the potential in this field and
            how it can change our lives after seeing AlphaGo defeated Lee Se-dol
            convincingly. I have pursued my dream of becoming a data scientist
            from that point. I currently have a foundation knowledge of Python
            and SQL and a little HTML and CSS. Besides, I also love reading
            about algorithms and ML. I believe that with the environment that
            RMIT provides, I can push through my limit and achieve higher points
            in my life.

            My name is Hoang Vinh Khue, and my student ID is s3927474. This is
            my second semester at RMIT in Hanoi, where I am studying Information
            Technology. Using computers to browse and explore the Internet as
            well as playing video games has always been one of my favorite
            pastimes since I was a child. As I've grown older, technology has
            become an increasingly important aspect of everyone's life,
            including mine. I've always been fascinated by how humans can
            develop things like computers and the Internet, and I would like to
            learn more about the topic of technology. I also really like playing
            video games and aspire to be a game developer. I firmly believe that
            RMIT would be the place that provides me with the environment and
            opportunity to pursue my dream

          <p>My name is Nguyen Dang Ha, my student id is s3924594. I was born and brought up in Hanoi. Gaming and using computers are my biggest hobbies.  My first experience with computer and technology is when I was 5. However, until I grew 13, was I only aware of how miraculous technology is, along with its rapid development at that point, my interest in IT was formed. Specifically, Iâ€™m always interested in how a program was created, how we made other people interact with our products with only clicks and touches,... Moreover, technology plays a bigger and bigger role in our society, it affects almost every aspect of our life. Even though I was far behind to what is called expert, I would give my best to contribute more in projects and hope to take another step in this field.
