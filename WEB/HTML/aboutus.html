                  <p>My name is Dao Anh Vu, and my student ID is s3926187. I grew up In Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam. Currently, I am a first-year student at RMIT University, studying for a degree in Information Technology. I consider myself to be a rather ordinary guy with a multitude of hobbies, including reading comic books, mysterious stories on the Internet, and of course playing video games. I frequently found myself immersed in a video game or stories with rich lore and spent dozens of hours learning about them. The thrill of unraveling a riddle, discovering why a character is the way they are, or how the game's universe came to be in its current shape fascinated me. Apart from that, I enjoy messing around with computers and learning about new technology. I feel incredibly fortunate to have had a chance to interact with computers at a young age. Since then, I have always been curious about how computers and applications work in the background, how codes can turn into characters that we control in video games, or how a click of a button can order pizza for us. By learning IT, I will be able to answer all those questions, plus I will also have the abilities and knowledge to possibly build my own applications. For the time being, I have some basic knowledge about programming languages like Python, JavaScript, a little bit of web programming with HTML, CSS as well as fundamental database concepts with MySQL. I hope that by joining RMIT, I can expand my understanding of computers and programming and therefore be better prepared for future jobs.</p>

                  <h2 class="slide-title">Bui Khac Tien</h2>
                  <p>My name is Bui Khac Tien, and my student ID is s3925982. I am currently 18 years old, and Hanoi is my hometown. Presently, this is my second semester in Bachelor of Information Technology. I have numerous hobbies, including reading books, playing tennis, playing drums, and especially solo traveling. An odd fact about me is I am an ambivert. It means sometimes I would be extraverted, and I would talk a lot and rant about life to other people, but also sometimes I would be introverted and want to be isolated at home. The introverted side of me has discovered the passion inside myself for computers and networks. At first, when I got to RMIT, I was very interested in the Data Analytics stream. However, after some weeks, I realized that Data Analytics was not for me because it requires many skills that do not fit me. Then, I remembered that I had played many games in the past, and when it went down for maintenance, I realized it was shut down due to the "cloud platform." Seeing it applicant widely throughout many software, I decided to switch my interest to the Cloud Technologies minor. Besides, I have been using computers for 16 years. When I was 3, my father brought home an IBM laptop and gave it to me to explore the "magic" at that time, the Internet. Soon, I developed a passion for Information Technology and how to use computers to solve real-life problems. I have learned basic Python, HTML, CSS, and some of MySQL for the time being. I believe with my dedication, in the future, I could apply my knowledge achieved from RMIT classes to real life.</p>

                  <p>My name is Hoang Vinh Khue, and my student ID is s3927474. This is my second semester at RMIT in Hanoi, where I am studying Information Technology. Using computers to browse and explore the Internet as well as playing video games has always been one of my favorite pastimes since I was a child. As I've grown older, technology has become an increasingly important aspect of everyone's life, including mine. I've always been fascinated by how humans can develop things like computers and the Internet, and I would like to learn more about the topic of technology, such as how humans are able to come up with new technologies everyday, or how AI is developed to perform tasks so effectively. I also really like playing video games and aspire to be a game developer as well as being an AI engineer. I firmly believe that RMIT would be the place that provides me with the environment and opportunity to pursue my dream.</p>

I discovered the potential in this field and how it can change our lives after seeing AlphaGo defeat Lee Se-dol convincingly. I have pursued my dream of becoming a data scientist from that point. I currently have a foundation knowledge of Python and SQL and a little HTML and CSS. Besides, I also love reading about algorithms and ML. I believe that with the environment that RMIT provides, I can push through my limit and achieve higher points in my life.</p>
